            Fire damage extends far beyond the flames. Smoke penetrates every surface, soot corrodes materials, and water from firefighting efforts adds additional damage. Professional restoration addresses all of these issues.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-brand-gray leading-relaxed">
            Quick action is critical—soot becomes increasingly difficult to remove over time and smoke odors can become permanent if not properly treated within days of a fire.
