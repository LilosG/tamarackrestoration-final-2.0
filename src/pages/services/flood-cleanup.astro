  { question: 'What should I do during a flood?', answer: 'Safety first—evacuate if water is rising. Turn off electricity if safe to do so. Don\'t walk through standing water. Once safe, document damage with photos and call for professional help immediately.' },
  { question: 'How is flood cleanup different from regular water damage?', answer: 'Flood water is Category 3 "black water"—highly contaminated with bacteria, sewage, chemicals, and debris. It requires specialized safety equipment, sanitization, and often more extensive material removal.' },
  { question: 'Will insurance cover flood damage?', answer: 'Standard homeowner\'s insurance usually doesn\'t cover flood damage. You need separate flood insurance through FEMA\'s National Flood Insurance Program or private insurers. We help with all documentation.' },
  { question: 'How long does flood cleanup take?', answer: 'Initial water removal: 1-2 days. Complete drying: 3-5 days. Full restoration including repairs: 1-3 weeks depending on extent of damage.' },
  { question: 'Is it safe to stay in my home after a flood?', answer: 'Usually no, at least initially. Flood water contamination, structural concerns, and electrical hazards make it unsafe. We\'ll assess and let you know when it\'s safe to return.' },
