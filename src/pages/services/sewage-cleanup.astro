  { question: 'What causes sewage backups?', answer: 'Common causes include clogged sewer lines, tree root intrusion, broken pipes, municipal sewer problems, and septic system failures. Heavy rain can also overwhelm systems.' },

  { question: 'Will insurance cover sewage cleanup?', answer: 'Often yes, if caused by sudden events like pipe bursts. Backups from neglected maintenance may not be covered. We document everything for your claim.' },
  { question: 'How do you eliminate sewage odors?', answer: 'We use industrial sanitizers, enzyme treatments, and professional deodorization equipment. Complete removal of contaminated materials is often necessary to fully eliminate odors.' },
  { question: 'Can I stay in my home during sewage cleanup?', answer: 'No, we strongly recommend leaving until cleanup is complete. Airborne pathogens from sewage pose serious health risks. We\'ll let you know when it\'s safe to return.' },
