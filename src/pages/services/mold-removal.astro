  { question: 'How do I know if I have a mold problem?', answer: 'Signs include visible mold growth, musty odors, water stains, recent water damage, and health symptoms like allergies or respiratory issues that improve when you leave the building.' },
  { question: 'Is mold dangerous to my health?', answer: 'Yes, mold can cause health problems especially for those with allergies, asthma, or compromised immune systems. Symptoms include congestion, throat irritation, coughing, and skin rashes.' },
  { question: 'How long does mold removal take?', answer: 'Small areas: 1-3 days. Larger contamination affecting multiple rooms: 3-7 days. We provide a detailed timeline after our inspection.' },
  { question: 'Will mold come back after removal?', answer: 'Not if done properly. We identify and fix the moisture source, completely remove all mold, and apply preventive treatments. We also provide guidance on preventing future growth.' },
  { question: 'Do I need to leave during mold removal?', answer: 'For small areas, usually no. For extensive contamination, we may recommend temporary relocation during active remediation for your safety.' },
  { question: 'Does insurance cover mold removal?', answer: 'It depends on the cause. Mold from sudden water damage (burst pipe) is usually covered. Mold from long-term neglect or flooding may not be. We help document claims for the best outcome.' },

            Mold isn't just unsightly—it's a health hazard. Mold releases spores and mycotoxins that can cause respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and other health issues, especially in children, elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-brand-gray leading-relaxed">
            DIY mold removal often makes the problem worse by spreading spores throughout your home. Professional remediation uses containment, HEPA filtration, and proper removal techniques to eliminate mold safely and completely.
