  { question: 'How do I know if I have a hidden water leak?', answer: 'Signs include unexplained high water bills, sounds of running water when nothing is on, wet spots on floors/walls/ceilings, musty odors, and low water pressure. Our detection technology can find leaks without tearing apart your home.' },
  { question: 'What is a slab leak?', answer: 'A slab leak is a leak in the water pipes running beneath your home\'s concrete foundation. They\'re serious because they can cause foundation damage, mold growth, and significant water damage if not addressed quickly.' },
  { question: 'How do you find hidden leaks?', answer: 'We use advanced technology including thermal imaging cameras, acoustic listening devices, and moisture meters to pinpoint leaks without invasive exploration. This saves time and minimizes damage to your property.' },
  { question: 'How much does leak detection cost?', answer: 'We offer competitive pricing for leak detection services. The cost depends on the complexity, but finding a leak early saves thousands in water damage repairs. We provide free estimates.' },
  { question: 'Can you repair the leak once you find it?', answer: 'Yes, we provide complete leak repair services. Depending on the location and severity, options include spot repairs, pipe rerouting, or repiping. We\'ll recommend the most cost-effective solution.' },
  { question: 'Will insurance cover leak repairs?', answer: 'Policies vary. Sudden pipe bursts are usually covered. Gradual leaks from wear may not be. The resulting water damage is often covered even when the repair isn\'t. We help document everything for your claim.' },
