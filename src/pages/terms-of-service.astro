            Welcome to {business.name}. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website and restoration services. By using our services, you agree to these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>Service Agreements</h2>
          <p>
            Before beginning restoration work, we will provide you with a written estimate or work authorization. This document will outline the scope of work, estimated costs, and other relevant details. By signing this authorization, you agree to the terms specified therein.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Emergency Services</h2>
          <p>
            For emergency situations, we may begin mitigation work before a full estimate is prepared to prevent further damage to your property. In such cases, we will document all work performed and provide detailed information for insurance purposes.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Insurance Claims</h2>
          <p>
            When we work with your insurance company on your behalf, you authorize us to communicate with your insurance carrier, submit documentation, and coordinate the claims process. You remain responsible for any costs not covered by your insurance policy, including deductibles.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
          <p>Payment terms vary based on the nature of the work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Insurance Claims:</strong> We can often bill your insurance company directly. You are responsible for your deductible and any non-covered costs.</li>

            <li><strong>Large Projects:</strong> May require progress payments as outlined in your service agreement.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Property Access</h2>
          <p>
            By engaging our services, you grant us access to the affected areas of your property as needed to perform restoration work. You agree to remove or secure personal belongings and valuables from work areas, or authorize us to move items as necessary.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Customer Responsibilities</h2>
