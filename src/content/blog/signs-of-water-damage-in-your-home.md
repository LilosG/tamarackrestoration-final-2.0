Water damage is one of the most common—and costly—problems homeowners face. The key to minimizing damage and repair costs is early detection. Here are seven warning signs that you may have water damage in your home.

## 1. Unexplained Increases in Your Water Bill

If your water bill suddenly spikes without a change in usage, you may have a hidden leak. Even small leaks can waste thousands of gallons over time and cause significant damage to your home's structure.

**What to do:** Check all visible pipes, faucets, and toilets. If you can't find an obvious leak, call a professional to inspect your plumbing.

## 2. Musty or Moldy Odors

A persistent musty smell, especially in basements, bathrooms, or near walls, often indicates hidden moisture and potential mold growth. Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of water exposure.

**What to do:** Don't ignore musty odors. Have a professional inspect for hidden water damage and mold.

## 3. Visible Mold Growth

While some mold is obvious (black spots on walls or ceilings), mold can also appear as fuzzy white patches, green spots, or even orange and pink stains in humid areas.

**What to do:** Small areas of mold (less than 10 square feet) can sometimes be cleaned with proper precautions. Larger areas require professional mold remediation.

## 4. Water Stains on Ceilings and Walls

Brown or yellow stains on ceilings and walls are telltale signs of water damage. These stains indicate that water has penetrated your building materials and may still be present.

**What to do:** Don't just paint over stains. Find and fix the source of water, then properly dry and repair the affected area.

## 5. Peeling, Bubbling, or Cracking Paint

When water gets behind walls, it causes paint and wallpaper to lose adhesion. Look for:

- Paint that's peeling or flaking
- Bubbles under wallpaper or paint
- Cracks in the wall surface

**What to do:** This indicates moisture in your walls. Investigate the source before repainting.

## 6. Warped, Buckling, or Soft Flooring

Water damage to flooring may appear as:

- Hardwood floors that are cupping, crowning, or buckling
- Tile floors with loose tiles or cracked grout
- Carpet that feels damp or has a musty smell
- Laminate flooring that's swelling or separating

**What to do:** Flooring damage often indicates significant water intrusion. Professional assessment is recommended.

## 7. Foundation Cracks or Pooling Water

Water damage to your foundation can compromise your entire home's structure. Watch for:

- Cracks in your foundation
- Water pooling around your home's perimeter
- Efflorescence (white mineral deposits) on basement walls

**What to do:** Foundation issues require immediate professional attention.

## When to Call a Professional

If you notice any of these warning signs, time is critical. Water damage worsens rapidly:

- **Within 1 hour:** Water spreads throughout materials
- **Within 24 hours:** Drywall swells, metal begins to rust
- **Within 48 hours:** Mold begins to grow
- **Within 1 week:** Structural damage accelerates
